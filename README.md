# Python-Project-Pillow-Tesseract-OpenCV-Coursera

These are my suggested solutions to the Coursera online course: Python Project: Pillow, Tesseract, OpenCV, offered by University of Michigan. 

This course walks us through a hands-on project suitable for a portfolio. I was introduced to third-party APIs and was shown how to manipulate images using the Python imaging library (pillow), how to apply optical character recognition (OCR) to images to recognize text (tesseract and py-tesseract), and how to identify faces in images using the popular opencv library. By the end of the course, I worked with three different libraries available for Python 3 to create a real-world data-analysis project.

Please note that these are not ideal solutions for the problems given out.
